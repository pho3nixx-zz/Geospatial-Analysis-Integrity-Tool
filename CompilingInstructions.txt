Instructions for debian based Linux

If you have a 64-Bit Linux, use the 32 Bit libraries!!

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential

You will need 
1) some additional libraries:
sudo apt-get install libmotif-dev libxpm-dev libxerces-c-dev libgdal-dev libtiff5-dev libgeotiff

2) Files and folders from an old Installation, like the "bin" folder etc...

3) you need to create an empty projects folder, or point to a valid projects folder via environment variable...
