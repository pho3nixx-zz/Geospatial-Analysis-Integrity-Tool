Instructions for debian based Linux

If you have a 64-Bit Linux, use the 32 Bit libraries!!

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential

You will need 
1) some additional libraries:
sudo apt-get install libmotif-dev libxpm-dev libxerces-c-dev libgdal-dev libtiff5-dev libgeotiff

2) Files and folders from an old Installation, like the "bin" folder etc...

3) you need to create an empty projects folder, or point to a valid projects folder via environment variable...

4) There is a share.h file missing. I created this file and included share_linux.h. If you compile on windows you probably have to include share_windows.h.
